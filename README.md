# Unity LangData asset extractor

A very simple utility which extracts all the strings into a readable text file from a LangData asset type (found in games such as Yu-Gi-Oh! Cross Duel).

It is similar to my [tool for Tag Force](https://github.com/xan1242/tagforcestring).



## TODO

- Rebuilding support
